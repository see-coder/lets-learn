## [Problem](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/repeat-and-missing-number-array/)

You are given a read only array of n integers from 1 to n.

Each integer appears exactly once except A which appears twice and B which is missing.

Return A and B.

`Note:` Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
