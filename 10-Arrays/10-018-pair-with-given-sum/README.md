## [Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-a-sorted-and-rotated-array-find-if-there-is-a-pair-with-a-given-sum/)

Given an array arr[] of distinct elements size N that is sorted and then rotated around an unknown point, the task is to check if the array has a pair with a given sum X.

`Example 1:`  
Input: arr[] = {11, 15, 6, 8, 9, 10}, X = 16  
Output: true  
Explanation: There is a pair (6, 10) with sum 16.

`Example 2:`  
Input: arr[] = {11, 15, 26, 38, 9, 10}, X = 35  
Output: true  
Explanation: There is a pair (26, 9) with sum 35.

`Example 3:`  
Input: arr[] = {11, 15, 26, 38, 9, 10}, X = 45  
Output: false  
Explanation: There is no pair with sum 45.
